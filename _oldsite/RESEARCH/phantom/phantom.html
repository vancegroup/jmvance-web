<p align="justify"><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
 
<p>Haptics refers to the sensing of force, weight, or other physical properties
through feeling and touch. The additional information from haptic or force
feedback makes certain engineering design tasks, such as part assembly, much
easier than using a traditional computer interface. Typically, haptic feedback
is combined with virtual reality through a stereo monitor or head mounted
display. This research project combined force feedback via the PHANToM haptic 
device with a projection screen virtual environment, the C6 at Iowa State
University, to explore the benefits to engineering design. To achieve this
goal several concepts are presented including a stand to hold the PHANToM
in the environment, a volume to scale the PHANToM's workspace to the virtual
world, and an application to control the PHANToM with the GHOST software.
Two example uses for haptic feedback in the virtual environment are presented,
a NURBS surface and a virtual assembly application. The assembly example
uses Boeing's Voxmap PointShell (VPS) software to produce a much more versatile 
application than what GHOST is capable of alone.  </p>

<p align="justify" style="font-style: normal;"><b>THE PHANToM</b></p>
 
<p align="justify">The PHANToM, (Personal HAptic iNTerface Mechanism), was
developed at MIT as a relatively low cost force feedback device for interacting
with virtual objects. Available through SensAble Technologies, the PHANToM
may be programmed with a specialized software developer's toolkit called
GHOST. Using GHOST makes the low-level work required to operate the PHANToM
transparent to the programmer, allowing him/her to focus on the haptic geometry
and properties of the simulation.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-style: normal;">KEY CONCEPTS</span><i> </i></b> </p>
 
<p><span style=""><span style="font-style: normal;">To integrate the PHANToM
with a projection screen virtual envi</span></span>ronment several obstacles
need to be overcome. First, the PHANToM is essentially a desktop device.
To use it in a larger environment the PHANToM must be made mobile and height
adjustable to accommodate the user. Second, the PHANToM device's 19x27x37cm
physical workspace is much smaller than the virtual environment's 10x10x10ft
cube. Some method must exist to make the PHANToM useful over larger portions
of the virtual world. Finally, a program must be written to operate the PHANToM
and integrate it with the software controlling the virtual environment.  </p>
 
<ul>
 	<li>
    <p><i><b>Phantom Stand</b></i></p>
 	
    <p>The phantom stand was designed to permit positioning, height 	adjustment,
and stable support of the PHANToM in the virtual 	environment. To avoid interference
with the magnetic tracking system 	used in the environment, the phantom stand
was constructed out of 	bonded PVC plastic and stainless steel hardware.
 	</p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p align="center">The phantom stand</p>
 
<ul>
 	<li>
    <p><i><b>Phantom Volume</b></i></p>
 	
    <p><span style=""><span style="font-style: normal;">The 	phantom volume
is</span></span> a user defined quadrilateral volume 	of space in the virtual
environment that maps motion of the 	PHANToM's physical endpoint to a position
in the virtual world. <span style=""><span style="font-style: normal;">The 
	phantom volume permits the limited PHANToM physical working volume 	to be
matched an used over an arbitrarily large space in the virtual 	environment.
To create a phantom volume the user selects two points 	in space with a hand
held wand. The orientation of the phantom 	stand, obtained from a magnetic
tracker, is used to orient the 	volume in space so it matches the PHANToM's
orientation. Once the 	phantom volume is built an example application may
be run which 	allows the PHANToM to interact with the geometry within the
phantom 	volume. A small red sphere represents the virtual PHANToM endpoint 
	position inside the volume.</span></span></p>

    <p><i><b>Phantom Driver</b></i></p>
 	
    <p>Integration of the PHANToM's GHOST software and vrJuggler, the 	software
driving the projection screen virtual environment, is 	handled by the phantom
driver program. The phantom driver is a C++ 	class that uses GHOST to setup
and start the PHANToM haptic process, 	loads the proper haptic geometry,
positions the PHANToM in the 	virtual environment, scales the PHANToM's physical
motion to 	movement in the virtual phantom volume, and communicates with
the 	rest of the simulation.  	</p>
 </li>
</ul>
 
<p><br>
<br>
 </p>
 
<p><b>EXAMPLE APPLICATIONS</b></p>
 
<p>In this research two example applications are presented that demonstrate
the advantages of using the PHANToM in a projection screen virtual environment:
a NURBS surface exploration example and a virtual assembly application that
uses Boeing's VPS (Voxmap PointShell) software.</p>
 
<ul>
 	<li>
    <p><i><b>NURBS Surface Example</b></i></p>
 	
    <p style="font-style: normal;">This example 	demonstrates using the GHOST
software to build the haptic 	representation of an existing NURBS (Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline) 	surface from its equations. The geometry is then displayed
in the 	virtual environment where the user may define a phantom volume 	around
and interact with any portion of the surface. This 	application lets the
user experience the additional information 	about an objects shape through
the sense of touch while exploring 	the differences between the PHANToM physical
workspace size and the 	virtual phantom volume workspace.  	</p>
 </li>

<ul>
 	<li>
    <p><i><b>Virtual Assembly Application</b></i></p>
 	
    <p><span style=""><span style="font-style: normal;">In 	this example
the user manipulates the PHANToM in an attempt to 	install a rudder pedal
assembly into the lower front portion of a 	light aircraft. The haptic feedback
provides a fast and intuitive 	way for a designer to determine if the assembly
task can be 	completed. Boeing's VPS software is used with GHOST to detect 
	collisions between the pedal assembly and the aircraft structure. 	Physically
based modeling is used to calculate the haptic forces 	resulting from any
collisions. GHOST is used to return these haptic 	forces to the PHANToM.
The resulting program is capable of using 	much more complicated models at
haptic feedback rates than GHOST 	alone.</span></span>  	</p>
