<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

This paper will present results of a research project which investigated 
incorporating finite element analysis results into a virtual environment. 
Three programs developed in the course of this research are described. 
MSC/NASTRAN is used to perform the analysis and WorldToolKit and GL are 
used to develop the virtual environment. Virtual reality peripherals 
including a head-mounted display and a BOOM are used with a 3D mouse as 
interface devices. Sensitivity methods are incorporated into the programs 
to allow the designer to change design variables and immediately view the 
effects without performing a re-analysis.
