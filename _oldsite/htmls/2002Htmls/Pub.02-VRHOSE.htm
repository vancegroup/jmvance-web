<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
Many industrial vehicles and machines
use hydraulic hoses to transfer power. When
designing these products, correctly routing the
hoses becomes a time consuming task. It is difficult
to specify the hose path in the three-dimensional
space of a complex product using the traditional
two-dimensional monitor, keyboard and mouse.
Further, because of the properties of hydraulic
hoses, it is difficult to predict the path that a
hydraulic hose would take when placed in the
product. VRHose is a hydraulic hose routing
design environment that uses virtual reality to
facilitate hose routing. The VRHose program is
integrated with EDS’s JackTM software. Although
JackTM software is generally used as a nonimmersive
design tool, this project takes advantage
of several aspects of the JackTM software to
develop a fully-immersive, head mounted display
implementation of a virtual reality application.
VRHose allows designers to specify the hose route
using an immersive virtual reality interface where a
mathematical model of the hose is used to predict
the final shape of the hose as it is placed in the
product. A discussion of the virtual reality
hardware used with VRHose is followed by a
description of the software design. Finally, an
example hose routing process is detailed.
