<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Virtual prototyping is the process of evaluating digital
versions of designs without building physical mockups. Industry
is increasingly turning to virtual prototyping in an effort to
reduce design time and costs. The ability to evaluate various
design configurations early in the design process using digital
models allows for more opportunity to optimize the product
design and explore alternate design configurations at a lower
product design cost. This paper describes the development of
virtual tools which give the designer the ability to take virtual
prototyping one step further by allowing interactive
modification to the virtual surfaces while in the virtual
environment.<br><br>
Virtual prototypes are created directly from computer aided
design (CAD) data. Non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS)
have become the industry standard for representation of free-form
curves and surfaces (Piegl, 1991). The contribution of the
work presented here is in the development of virtual tools which
are used to operate directly on the CAD data and change the
shape of the NURBS surfaces in a virtual environment. The
virtual tools can be dragged along or pushed into the surface in
real-time to change its shape. The surface normal at an arbitrary
point can be manipulated in three-dimensional (3D) space.
Constraint-based surface manipulation is used to obtain
multiple point direct manipulation of NURBS surfaces, which is
not currently available in other VR CAD programs.
