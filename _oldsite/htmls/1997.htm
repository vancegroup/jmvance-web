<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper will present results of a research project which investigated incorporating
finite element analysis results into a virtual environment. Three programs developed in
the course of this research are described. MSC/NASTRAN is used to perform the analysis and
WorldToolKit and GL are used to develop the virtual environment. Virtual reality
peripherals including a head-mounted display and a BOOM are used with a 3D mouse as
interface devices. Sensitivity methods are incorporated into the programs to allow the
designer to change design variables and immediately view the effects without performing a
re-analysis. <br>
