<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Virtual reality (VR) provides a design space consisting of three-dimensional 
computer images where participants can interact with these images using natural 
human motions in real time. In the field of engineering design, prototyping and 
design verification have provided the initial application areas for VR. The 
research presented in this paper takes the scenario one step further by 
incorporating free-form deformation techniques and sensitivity analysis into 
the virtual world such that the designer can easily implement analysis-based 
shape design of a structural system where stress considerations are important. 
NURBS-based free-form deformation (NFFD) methods and direct manipulation 
techniques are used as the interface between the VR interaction and the finite 
element model. Sensitivity analysis is used to allow the designer to change the 
design model and immediately view the effects without performing a re-analysis. 
An engine connecting rod is analyzed to demonstrate how virtual reality 
techniques can be applied to structural shape design.
