<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

This paper presents a framework for generating and interacting with the line
congruences associated with four general nite poses. These line congruences
are the solution space of spatial 4C mechanisms which will guideaworkpiece
through the four prescribed poses. Hence, the contributions of this paper are
applicable to developing interactive tools for designing spatial 4C
mechanisms
for four pose motion generation.
First, a methodology for generating a parameterized representation of the
line congruences is reviewed. This is followed by strategies for visually
repre-
senting the line congruences which are appropriate for both workstation and
immersive virtual reality computer graphics. Next, strategies and supporting
algorithms for interacting with the line congruences to obtain solution
mecha-
nisms with xed links or coupler links in desired regions of the workspace are
presented.
The result is an intuitive interactive visual design methodology for generat-
ing and interacting with the line congruences associated with four
general nite
spatial poses. Our hope is that this tool will in turn facilitate the
creation of
both virtual reality and workstation-based computer-aided design software for
spatial 4C mechanism design.
