<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Mechanisms are used in many devices to move a rigid body through a finite sequence
of prescribed locations.  The most commonly used mechanisms are four-bar planar
mechanisms that move an object in one plane in space.  Spatial mechanisms allow
motion in three-dimensions (3D), however to date they are rarely implemented in 
industry due to the inherent visualization and design challenges involved.
Nevertheless, they do provide promise as a practical solution to spatial motion
generation and therefore remain an active area of research.  Spatial 4C mechanisms
are two degree of freedom kinematic closed-chains consisting of four rigid links
simply connected in series by cylindrical (C) joints.  A cylindrical joint is a two
degree of freedom joint which allows translation along and rotation about a line
in space.  This paper describes a synthesis process for the design of 4C spatial 
mechanisms in a virtual environment.  Virtual reality allows the user to view and
interact with the digital models in a more intuitive way than using the traditional
human-computer interface (HCI).  The software developed as part of this research
also allows multiple users to network and share the designed mechanism.  Networking
tools have the potential to greatly enhance communication between members of the
design team at different industrial sites and therefore reduce design costs.
