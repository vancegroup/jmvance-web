<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Our overall goal is to develop software that facilitates the interactive participation of
the designer in the optimization process. We are focusing this research on problems which
use finite element solutions as part of the objective function. One challenge to
implementing interactive participation in these types of problems is the high
computational burden of computing each finite element solution for each design change. The
research presented here focuses on a unique method to develop fast approximation methods
for natural frequencies and mode shapes which can be used to avoid the time-consuming
re-solution process and which will facilitate interactive design for systems with even
large design changes.<br>
