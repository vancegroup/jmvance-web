<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>
<BR>
A networked virtual environment is a hardware and software system where people who are 
geographically dispersed over the world can interact with each other by sharing space, 
presence, and time. The goal of the work presented here is to develop methods to 
facilitate the use of force feedback, or haptic, devices within a networked virtual 
environment. Our research aims at investigating and constructing a networked haptic 
environment (NHE) over a non-dedicated channel for multiple users. The NHE consists 
of a local network between each haptic device and each virtual environment, as well 
as a global network linking all of the virtual environments. Position synchronization 
throughout the global network is accomplished using "Released-but-not-released" 
method (RNR) which allows computers with different performance capabilities to 
participate in the network without users experiencing inaccurate object motions. The 
networked virtual assembly application has been demonstrated using several haptic 
devices and several virtual environments, without a limitation on number of users or 
complexity of input models. Performance measures are examined and future work is outlined.
