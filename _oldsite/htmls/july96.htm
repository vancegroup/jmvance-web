<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Now that virtual reality (VR) peripherals have matured to the point where 
practical applications are starting to appear, the use of virtual reality 
as a common design tool is fast approaching. A case in point is Iowa 
State University's Iowa Center for Emerging manufacturing Technology. 
Engineers here are developing interactive designs based on sensitivity 
methods and finite element results, effectively demonstrating the active 
role designers can play in the analysis and optimization of structural 
systems to achieve easy, quick design included designers, stress 
analysts, lifting, and materials engineers-used MSC/MVISION Builder to 
create the database over a period of 18 months. Materials data from the 
sytem is accessed directly from MSC/PATRAN's materials module, and may be 
exported from the database into other CAE applications for stress and 
thermal analysis of components.
