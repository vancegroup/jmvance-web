<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The design of complex mechanical systems is often accomplished by dividing the task into
the design of smaller subsystems. When design changes are made at the subsystem level, the
affect of these changes on other subsystems can be unknown. Further, when the subsystems
are optimized, the end result is a design consisting of optimal subsystems, not
necessarily the overall optimal design. This is often the case because design changes that
result in improving the performance of one subsystem, often degrade the performance of
other subsystems. In other words, optimizing the subsystem sub-optimizes the system. This
design dilemma motivated the development of software that allows a user to specify design
changes and project the performance effects on several subsystems interactively. Due to
the large amount of information that needs to be supplied to the designer, computer
graphics tools are used to display the data. The software is written using C, OSF/Motif
version 1.2.3 and OpenGL and is implemented on a Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation running
Irix 5.2.<br>
