<b> Overview </b>
<p> The design of spherical mechanisms is an inherently spatial problem.  
Spherical mechanisms are pin-jointed spatial linkages which are used to 
move an object along a three-dimensional path in space. A spherical 
mechanism differs from a planar mechanism in the orientation of its axes
of revolution. In a planar mechanism all the axes of the pin joints
are parallel. In a spherical mechanism, however, all of the axes of
revolution intersect at a single point. This constrains each of the
pin joints to lie on concentric spheres about this point.
The understanding and insight gained through the immersion and
interaction inherent in Virtual Environment Design, lend significant
enhancements to the synthesis of spherical mechanisms.

<p> During synthesis, markers are initially placed on a conceptual sphere
indicating the desired position and orientation of the coupler link in 
each of the four positions. Next, the fixed pivots of the driving and 
driven links are chosen from the circle and center point cones. Finally, 
a mechanism and coupler curve are generated.

<p> This application is based on a spherical linkage synthesis software 
package called SPHINX from the University of California, Irvine and a 
virtual reality toolkit called <A HREF="http://www.sense8.com/sense8.html"> 
WorldToolKit </A>.
