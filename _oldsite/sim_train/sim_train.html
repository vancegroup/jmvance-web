<b> Overview </b>

<p>

The objective of this project is to design software to train or re-train
workers enrolled at two year post secondary institutions
in the operation of computer-controlled manufacturing equipment. 
Simulation-based training can be implemented to provide cost effective 
training on a wide variety of manufacturing tools. Libraries of equipment 
models can be developed and upgraded as new machines are introduced to the 
marketplace. In addition, simulation-based training provides a safe 
environment where novice machine tool operators can learn without fear of 
injury to themselves or to the equipment.
A larger student-to-instructor ratio can be maintained in this safe environment , 
resulting in further cost savings. 
Also, with each student at a workstation, students are not 
restricted to operate the machinery in groups and therefore each student 
can gain individual experience programming the machines. 
This software 
particularly focus on training workers to manipulate a robot. It includes 
PUMA560, a teach pendant and an editor which is used for editing VAL II 
program. PUMA560 is created by using TELEGRIP, and both of the teach
pendant and editor are created by using MOTIF.
