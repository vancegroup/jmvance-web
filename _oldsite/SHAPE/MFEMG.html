The car frame geometry shown results from a finite element model (A).  The
designer first constructs a control point lattice that surrounds the car 
frame (B).  This lattice can be sized and placed anywhere around the object 
to define the area where shape change can occur.  The user then selects 
several control points and moves these points, causing the embedded finite 
element model to change shape (C,D).  This can be performed in 
three-dimensional space using virtual reality interaction devices such as 
the Pinch Glove or the Cyberglove.
