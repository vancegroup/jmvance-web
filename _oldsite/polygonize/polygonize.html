<h3> Overview </h3>
<P>
    
	This algorithm provides a method to tessellate a surface 
into a reduced polygonal mesh while retaining all salient geometric 
features. Other polygonization techniques restrict the final mesh to
a rectangular topology or are based on recursive subdivision schemes. 
The method developed in this research models surface polygonization as 
a specialized form of a mesh reduction problem. Unlike general mesh 
decimation techniques, this method is able to take advantage of the fact 
that the precise surface definition is known before polygonization is attempted.
The mesh reduction is accomplished by using a general process called "edge
reduction" along boundaries and interiors of subregions of the surface. 
In edge reduction, an edge in the mesh is deleted by replacing it's two 
vertices with one new vertex. This new vertex is located by solving a 
maximin optimization problem or is arbitrarily located at the centroid of 
the feasible region. The quality of the mesh is determined by a user-selected 
criterion. Since the algorithm operates on local subregions of the mesh, global
minimization of the mesh size and symmetry properties are not guaranteed.
The results of a series of tests show the method proves to be insensitive to
the initial grid size and the starting location of the reduction process.
Optimization-based mesh reduction produces substantially smaller meshes compared 
to implementation without optimization.
