<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OVERVIEW</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VRNETS was developed as a software package for designing 4C 
spatial mechanisms in a virtual environment with networking. The software was developed
at <A HREF = "http://www.iastate.edu">Iowa State University</A> by John Kihonge, a 
graduate research assistant, working with <A HREF = "..">Dr. Judy Vance</A>. The project was 
funded by the <A HREF = "http://www.nsf.gov">National Science Foundation</A>.

<P>

Spatial 4C mechanisms 
are composed of four links and four cylindrical joints (CCCC) and provide motion 
in a three-dimensional (3D) space. A spatial mechanism can be designed to move a 
rigid body through a finite sequence of prescribed locations in space. Four 
positions and orientations are prescribed and kinematics synthesis is performed 
to obtain a set of solution for the size and orientation of possible links of the 
mechanisms.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VRNETS uses computation routines from SPADES, a monitor-based 
spatial mechanism software developed by 
<A HREF = "http://www.fit.edu/AcadRes/engsci/mechanic/larochel.html">Dr. Pierre 
Larochelle</A> at <A HREF = "http://www.fit.edu">Florida Institute of Technology </A>. 
VRNETS was developed using 
object-oriented C++ programming on <A HREF = "http://www.sgi.com">SGI IRIX</A> (UNIX-based) platform. The virtual environment and networking is developed using 
the <A HREF = "http://www.sense8.com">WorldToolKit (WTK), WTK Immersive 
Display Option (WTKIDO) and World2World</A> software. VRNETS was designed for 
display in Iowa State University's <A HREF = "http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/about/selab/">
C2 facility</A> (a CAVE-based virtual environment). 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Iowa State University, prior virtual reality design 
environemnt for spatial mechanism design has focussed on spherical mechanisms. 
Scott Osborn, a graduate student working with Dr. Judy Vance, developed 
<A HREF = "../SPHERE/Sphere1.html">SphereVR</A> 
as a virtual environment for the design of spherical mechanisms. Next, Juliet 
Kraal, another graduate student assistant at Iowa State University, developed 
<A HREF = "../SPHERE/VEMECS.htm"> VEMECS (Virtual 
Environment MEChanism Synthesis) </A>. Todd Furlong, another graduate assistant 
at Iowa State University, developed 
<A HREF = "../ISIS/isis.html">Isis (Interactive 
Synthesis of Spherical Mechanisms) </A>.

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">INTERACTION and MENUS</P>
</B></I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interaction is performed using 
<A HREF = "http://www.fakespace.com">Fakespace</A> PINCH Glove. 
The PINCH Glove has a conductive material placed on the finger tips, thumb and 
palm of the glove to register contact between a user's fingers, palm and thumb. 
PINCH Gloves are more natural than a 3D mouse and they can be used for a wide 
range of gestures. To represent a user's hand in the virtual environment, a 
digital hand model is loaded and the virtual hand is animated by rearranging the 
joints of the model to preprogrammed configurations.Menus are used to provide 
more options for interaction with the VR environment.  The menus are 3D objects 
consisting of a menu bar and text items. The main menu can be opened at any time 
during the design process. A menu bar can be repositioned in space, allowing the 
user to move the menu to a location in the virtual environment that is convenient.</P>

</b></b>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After four positions are specified, the user synthesizes 
all possible mechanisms for the four positions specified and displays the results 
in the form desired. The results are presented as either a type map or congruences. 
A type map is a 2D color-coded plot of the types of the mechanism representing the 
solutions for the problem specified. Spatial mechanisms are classified according to 
the mechanism type of their corresponding spherical image. The spherical image is a 
spherical four-bar mechanism with link lengths equal to the angular twist of the 
links of the spatial 4C mechanism. Moving and/or fixed congruences can be drawn. 
The moving congruences represent the driving dyad choices and the fixed congruencies 
represent the driven dyad choices. The moving and fixed congruences are drawn in 
yellow and red colors, respectively</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A mechanism can been chosen from the type map or from the 
congruences and animated to verify if it completes the task required. The user can 
observe the motion of the mechanism to see whether the mechanism collides with 
objects in the virtual space and whether it goes through the positions in the 
required order. After getting a desirable mechanism, an output file of the 
mechanism generated can be saved by selecting "Save Mechanism" option from 
the File menu.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VRNETS sends position translations and rotations, and mechanism 
link lengths, translations and rotations over the network to other users. Only one
 of the users in the VR network is allowed to input the initial position information 
and to design a mechanism. The position information will be sent out to the 
simulation server and the other users will get the update for the position and the 
designed mechanism. The update for the position and mechanism data is done as soon 
as a change is made and the other users see the changes as they happen. However, the 
networking system speed will determine how fast the changes are received by the 
other users. After the mechanism has been designed, any of the users can animate the 
mechanism using the PINCH Glove and the menu interactions. The animation data is 
sent to all the users and they will see the mechanism animated in their VR 
environment. </P>
