<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
This project will result in the development of a virtual environment to facilitate the design of 
spherical mechanisms. Spatial mechanisms are devices composed of mechanical links and hinged 
and sliding joints that are designed to produce complex three-dimensional motion. Spherical 
mechanisms are the simplest class of spatial mechanisms. These mechanisms provide the means 
to move and orient an object along a complex 3D path. Often today, this type of motion is provided 
by a series of planar mechanisms. One example is mechanism used to store the folding table 
attached to a lecture hall seat. This mechanism consists of two independent planar mechanisms 
that result in fully 3D motion.<p>

Spherical mechanisms are rarely used in industry today because the form and function of 
these mechanisms is difficult to visualize until a prototype has been built. The geometric complexity 
of the solution space is beyond the ability of existing systems to present clearly and use
fully. The unique 3D nature of the design environment provided by virtual reality is the only 
vehicle for providing a usable design tool for the design of spatial mechanisms. A computer tool 
providing a 3D design space where the designer could synthesize spherical mechanisms and 
obtain a sense of the form and function of the devices while still in a computer modeled form 
would open up the possibilities for spatial mechanisms to be incorporated into many products 
including manufacturing equipment and consumer products. The replacement of several planar 
mechanisms with one spherical mechanisms will result in a solution with fewer links, fewer driving 
motors, more reliability and lower cost. Providing a virtual environment for spatial mechanism 
design will not only open new possibilities for invention of new mechanisms, but also will 
provide new knowledge pertaining to the use of virtual reality as a design tool.<p> 

Researchers from the <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu/" TARGET="_top">University of California, Irvine</A>, <A HREF="http://www.fit.edu/" TARGET="_top">Florida Institute of Technology</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.iastate.edu/" TARGET="_top">Iowa State University</A> have joined in this proposal to build such a design tool. Preliminary results 
have shown the need for advancement of spherical mechanism design methodology as well as an 
evaluation of the suitability of various virtual reality menu structures, interaction devices and display 
devices to the task of engineering product design. <p>

<H3>History</H3>


<P>
The need for better software to design spherical mechanisms results from the
experiences of <A HREF="http://www.eng.uci.edu/~maeadmin/Faculty/McCARTHY.html" 
TARGET="_top">Professor J. Michael McCarthy</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.fit.edu/AcadRes/engsci/mechanic/larochel.html" TARGET="_top">
Professor Pierre Larochelle</A>, and <A HREF=".." TARGET="_top">Professor Judy Vance</A>.<BR>

<BR>Four-bar spherical mechanisms are the
simplest types of spatial mechanisms and yet even these are difficult to design
using existing computer tools. Most engineers are familiar with planar
mechanisms such as the planar four-bar shown in Figure 1a. The simplest spatial
mechanism, the spherical four-bar, is shown in Figure 1b. The spherical
mechanism consists of four links joined by four revolute (4R) joints, all of
which have axes of revolution that meet in a single point: the center of the
spherical constraint surface transversed by the links. In these closed-chain
mechanisms, the motion of each link is affected by the motion of the adjoining
links.

<P>
In the late 70s and early 80s, interactive computer graphics design programs
were developed for planar mechanism design based on Burmester's (1886)
geometric design procedures. The first computer graphics program was Kaufman's
KINSYN (Kaufman 1978), followed shortly by Erdman's LINCAGES package (Erdman
and Gustafson 1977), and later by Waldron's RECSYN (Waldron and Song 1981).
These programs enable rapid design and analysis of planar linkages, allowing
the inventor to survey the dimensions and evaluate the movement of many
linkages during one design session.
<P>
In the early 1990's Larochelle and McCarthy turned to interactive
workstation-based computer graphics to develop a tool to design spherical
mechanisms. For spherical linkages, the first computer-based synthesis
techniques were described by Suh and Radcliffe (1967) and Roth (1967). This was
later expanded by Dowler et al. (1978). Reinholtz et al. (1986) generalized
Filemon's (1972) ideas for avoiding problematic spherical linkage types. The
first interactive graphics-based spherical linkage design system, SPHINX, was
developed by Larochelle and McCarthy in 1993 (Larochelle et al. 1993).The user
interface to the SPHINX software is shown in Figure 2.
<P>
The design of a spherical mechanism using SPHINX is accomplished by first
specifying the desired positions and orientations of the coupler link in up to
4 discrete positions. For each design specification, 160,000 mechanisms exist.
To limit the solution set to a usable number of alternative solutions,
constraints are needed. Two approaches are available to input constraints on
the design. The user can either specify the positions of the pivots or choose
the type of mechanism that is desired. The first approach is based on selecting
the location of the fixed and moving pivots using the congruence cones. The
second approach is based on selecting the type of mechanism desired from the
160,000 linkages which are generated by SPHINX from the input design position
data. These linkage possibilities are displayed as a color coded map, called
the linkage type map, shown in the lower part of Figure 2. Once the constraints
are specified, the mechanism is displayed and the designer can animate the
movement and edit the final form of the linkage to plan the construction of a
prototype.

<P>
 In a related, but independent effort, Scott Osborn, a graduate
assistant working with Prof. Vance, developed <A HREF="Sphere1.html">SphereVR</A> (Figure
3), a virtual reality environment for the design of spherical mechanisms. The
approach is slightly different from SPHINX. A 3D mouse is used to place the
design positions on the sphere and to press buttons on a virtual menu tablet to
specify constraints on the individual link pivot point locations. The linkage
type map and the congruence cones are not generated, but rather, the individual
link pivot points are constrained to lie on user-specified geometric planes.
Once synthesized, the linkage can be animated to examine the motion. The 3D
mouse is also used to input commands such as Solve and Animate that appear on
the virtual menu tablet. The program can be implemented using a variety of
visual display devices including stereo glasses, a head-mounted display or a
head-coupled display (BOOM). This allows the designer to move relative to the
sphere to view it from a many different viewpoints.

Next, Juliet Kraal, another graduate assistant at Iowa State University created
<A HREF="VEMECS.htm">VEMECS</A> (Virtual Environment MEChanism Synthesis). This program was displayed in
stereo on a projection screen and viewed using CrystalEyes stereo glasses. Interaction
with the virtual objects was performed using the Pinch Gloves. A menu system replaced
the virtual menu object used in SphereVR. The design process more closely followed the
procedure used in the workstation-based SPHINX program.

<P> Currently, <!A HREF="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~tfurlong">
        Todd Furlong<!/A>, a graduate assistant at Iowa State University, is working on the 3rd evolution of the virtual mechanism
design application, <A HREF="../ISIS/isis.html">Isis</A> (Interactive Synthesis of Spherical Mechanisms). The approach now is to provide virtual objects in the environment so
that designing the mechanisms can be performed in context. Instead of placing abstract 
coordinate systems in place on the design sphere, the user places instances of the part that
needs to move. Pivots can be selected that relate to the attachment of the mechanism to it's base
part. This program uses CrystalEyes stereo glasses and a projection screen or an n-Vision helmet or 
the C2 for display. Interaction is provided using the pinch gloves.

Two recent projects at the University of California at Irvine (UCI) which were
developed using the SPHINX software have resulted in usable spherical four-bar
mechanisms: the UCI Hinge and the UCI Joy-stick Support Linkage. The UCI Hinge
(Figure 4) was designed to stow the communication table of a wheelchair-bound
individual from a position in the lap to a position beside the wheelchair.
Traditional means to accomplish this task employ two planar mechanisms attached
in series. Here, the spherical mechanism can perform the same motion, providing
a smoother transition for the table and using fewer links in the mechanism. The
UCI Joy-stick Support Linkage (Figure 5) was designed to deploy the chin
joy-stick controller for a quadriplegic from behind a wheelchair into position
in front of the operator. This linkage is in use at the Center for Applied
Rehabilitation Technology at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital. Used in a
manufacturing setting, similar linkages can provide pick and place movements
that are equivalent to robotic systems at a much lower cost and complexity.

A recent project at the Florida Institute of Technology has resulted in the
design and manufacture of a spherical four bar mechanism which deploys and
retracts the wings on the AviAuto (figure 6) roadable aircraft. The AviAuto is a prototype
roadable aircraft, or flying car, that is being developed at Florida Tech. In
previous designs of the AviAuto, two planar hinges, each actuated by a stepper
motor and gear head, were used to deploy and retract each wing. Implementation
of the spherical mechanism design has resulted in significant cost and weight
savings.
