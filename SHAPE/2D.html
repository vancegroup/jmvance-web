A fixed end cantilever beam subject to a concentrated vertical load 
is modeled using finite elements.  After an initial finite element 
calculation, the vonMises stresses can be displayed on the beam(A). 
A two-dimensional control point lattice is constructed around the 
beam model.  The designer then selects a single control point 
(shown in red).  As the designer moves the control point, both 
the surface and the stresses change (B, C, D).  The boundary nodes 
of the beam are mapped to the control point surface using NURBS 
free form deformation methods.  The interior node locations are 
calculated using Laplace smoothing methods.  The stress changes 
are approximated using the sensitivities of the element stresses to 
changes in the control point lattice.
