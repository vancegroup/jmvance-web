<STRONG> Overview </STRONG>
<p>

VEGAS (a <b>V</b>irtual <b>E</b>nvironment
for <b>G</b>eneral <b>AS</b>sembly), provides engineers with a tool to
investigate assembly feasibility. The application works with model data
derived from popular CAD software packages like Pro/Engineer.&nbsp; The
advantage of VEGAS is its flexibility to populate a virtual environment
with various models, with minimal limitations on size, shape or complexity,
without having to recompile a specific assembly situation.&nbsp; Assuming
the parametric data from the CAD packages can be read into a tessellation
routine, and turned into triangles, essentially any model can be recognized
by VEGAS. Once in the virtual environment the engineers can interact with
their models to perform assembly tasks as they would in the physical world.&nbsp;
By allowing the assembly planning to occur with digital models as opposed
to physical mock-up the engineers can save time and money by trying many
different options relatively easily. As the assembly methods are being
analyzed, collision detection algorithms are used
to tell the user if the parts fit together or if there are some undesirable
interferences taking place.
