<h3> Overview </h3>
<P>


The objective of this project is to combine virtual reality (VR) 
and engineering design to allow a designer to play an 
active role in the design sensitivity and optimization process.
Virtual reality techniques provide a computer-generated 
environment for the designer to investigate multiple design changes
while viewing and manipulating virtual objects 
by using natural human motion. Interactive design allows 
the designer to change design parameters and immediately 
determine the effect of the change by using sensitivity-based approximations. 
Keeping the designer active in the VR design process allows insights that
have been gained from experience to be incorporated into the optimization 
process, resulting in better designs achieved in a timely manner.
