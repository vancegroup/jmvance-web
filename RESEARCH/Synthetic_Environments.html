<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>
<BR>The objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a virtual environment for use in training, assembly, and maintenance methods. This project extends the work that has been performed in the Virtual Manufacturing and Assembly project. The focus is on providing an environment where a worker can interact with digital parts and evaluate the proposed assembly method before physical prototypes are built.
