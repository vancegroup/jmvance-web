<b>Overview</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">This research explores using virtual reality (VR) as a tool for designing
spatial 4C mechanisms for rigid-body guidance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Spatial
4C mechanisms are two degree of freedom closed kinematic chains consisting of
four links connected by cylindrical (C) joints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
</span>A cylindrical joint provides both translational and rotational movement
along its axis. </span>Spatial mechanisms offer a better alternative to
electronically controlled multiple-input devices, such as robotic manipulators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Being purely mechanical devices, spatial mechanisms are less expensive,
more reliable and more energy efficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
single spatial mechanism is often capable of completing a motion task that would
otherwise require several planar mechanisms to accomplish.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite the potential benefits associated with operation of spatial
mechanisms, development of such mechanical systems has been hindered by the lack
of the appropriate mechanism design software applications.</p>
<p align="left">Spatial mechanisms operate within three-dimensional design
space. The traditional human-computer interfaces (HCI) are limited to two
dimensions and impose artificial constraints on the ability of the mechanism
designers to correctly and efficiently specify the design problem and
investigate the spatial mechanism synthesis results. Virtual reality provides a
truly three-dimensional alternative to the traditional HCI's. The overall
spatial layout of a mechanism design problem as well as the correct dimensions
of the synthesized mechanisms are easily evaluated in the VR environments.&nbsp;</p>

  program was created in order to aid in the synthesis of spatial 4C mechanisms.
  The program allowed users to investigate the design parameters associated with
  spatial 4C mechanisms, such as the input design positions and the congruence
  planes, in a 3-D environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
  </span>Additionally, it provided the option of networking several instances of
  the application in order to facilitate a collaborative design process. While
  the program proved to be an effective tool in the synthesis and analysis of
  spatial 4C mechanisms, improvements and modifications to the program’s
  structure and functionality were needed in order to take full advantage of the
  virtual reality design environment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;This

  program, and incorporates the needed changes into a new piece of software.</span></span></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent">The VRSpatial application was developed as a
  result of this research.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
  software package for designing spatial 4C mechanisms using virtual reality
  that offers the mechanism designers a wide variety of methods for defining the
  initial design problem, solving the problem, and evaluating the solution’s
  feasibility. VRSpatial is written in the C++ programming language. Creation of
  the computer graphics objects and management of the VR environment is achieved
  with the SGI OpenGL<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">ä</span>&nbsp;
  API&nbsp; and the VRJuggler virtual reality software library. Computation
  routines from Florida Institute of Technology’s SPADES software package,
  developed by
    <a href="http://www.fit.edu/AcadRes/engsci/mechanic/larochel.html">Dr.
    Pierre Larochelle</a>, are used to perform mechanism synthesis and analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The user interaction method consists of a position-tracked wand and a
  set of virtual menus, along with a speech recognition interface.</p>
  <p>When compared to the functionality of the original VRNETS application, the
  new spatial mechanism design program offers its users an assortment of new and
  improved features.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the
  novel program characteristics are listed below:</p>

      facility</a>.</li>
    <li>Improved methods of specifying the initial design problem, such as the
      ability to numerically adjust positions of the design objects, provide for
      more effective design.</li>
    <li>Multiple options are available for investigating the generated solution
      space, including dynamic congruence planes recalculation, the ability to
      select arbitrary lines from congruence planes, extension of the mechanism
      type identification and solution filtering options to the congruence
      planes, and the ability to investigate the guide map and the congruence
      planes simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Three-position mechanism synthesis functionality is provided.</li>
    <li>Speech command interface offers an alternative way of interacting with
      the application.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The result of this research is an advanced, multi-functional, and highly
  flexible application for design of spatial 4C mechanisms for motion generation
  tasks. It is hoped that the use of this program will facilitate expansion of
  the spatial mechanism investigation activities and will lead to their expanded
  use in industrial applications.</p>
