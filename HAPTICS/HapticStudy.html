<STRONG> Overview </STRONG>
<p>
The evaluation of new computer devices can provide information for the 
future development of innovations, as well as for integration of these new 
devices into existing systems and practices.  This study measures the effect 
of haptic sensation on the evaluation of virtual prototypes.  The haptic 
device PHANToM allows users to experience the feel of force feedback in 
order to convey information between the user and the virtual environment.  
<p>
The main objective of this study was to evaluate how the information
provided by the haptic
device affects a person's ability to make design decisions in the
virtual environment. Participants were asked to detect and estimate linear
and angular differences between alternative

virtual parking brake designs</A>.  Several measurements were used in order to 
statistically compare 
the performance of participants from two groups, haptic versus nonhaptic.  
<p>
The study found that the haptic treatment significantly improved the 
precision of estimations in most cases as well as significantly reduced the 
time required for design evaluation.  A survey of participants' preference 
between the treatments revealed a strong preference for the haptic 
treatment.  In addition, several study observations may advance the 
integration of this new technology into practice, as well as initiate new 
research in the area of virtual prototyping and haptic sensation.  Several 
recommendations are made to improve the experimental design of future human 
factor studies related to mechanical sensations and virtual reality.
