The purpose of this project was to investigate the role that visualization and 
virtual reality could play in the decision making process when manufacturers 
are faced with investing in new technology. Often, traditional accounting methods
do not reflect many of the hidden benefits of implementing new manufacturing technology. 
To investigate potential changes in processing and the effect these changes would
produce on the cost/benefit of implementation of new technology, a discrete event
simulation has been combined with a virtual reality factory. This factory
provides a visual, 
three-dimensional space in which to explore the effect of various product mixes,
inspection schedules, and worker experience on productivity. Eventually, the model
will include changes to the machines in the cell.

This model was based on an actual flexible machining line at the Sauer-Sundstrand
factory in Ames, Iowa. The geometric models of all the machines were created and
implemented in a virtual world. The output of the simulation software AweSim is
used to control the part flow through the factory. The virtual environment
can be viewed in the <A HREF = "http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/about/selab/"><i>C2</A></i>, 
an <A HREF = "http://www.nvis.com"><i>N-vision</A></i> helmet, or stereo projected on a screen
and viewed using <A HREF = "http://www.stereographics.com"><i>CrystalEyes</A></i> stereo glasses. The
interaction device is a 
<A HREF="http://www.fakespace.com"><i>Fakespace</A></i> PinchGlove equipped with a 
<A HREF="http://www.ascension-tech.com"><i>Flock of Birds</A></i> tracker.
Additional details on the
creation of the virtual factory and the implementation of the discrete event
software output can be found in the publication listed below.
