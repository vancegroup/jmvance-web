<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to enhance the engineering 
design process, but before industry embraces them, the benefits must be understood 
and documented.  The current research compared two software applications, one 
which uses a traditional human-computer interface (HCI) and one which uses a 
virtual reality HCI, that were developed to aid engineers in designing complex 
three-dimensional spherical mechanisms.  Participants used each system to design 
a spherical mechanism and then evaluated the different interfaces.  Participants 
rated their ability to interact with the computer images, their feelings about 
each interface, and their preferences for which interface device to use for 
certain tasks.  The results indicated that participants preferred a traditional 
interface for interaction tasks and a VR interface for visual tasks.  These 
results provide information about how to improve implementation of VR technology, 
specifically for complex three-dimensional design applications.<p>
