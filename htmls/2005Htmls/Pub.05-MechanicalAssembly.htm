&nbsp;<BR>
This paper presents the development of a PC-based 3D human computer 
interface for virtual assembly applications. This system is capable of 
importing complex CAD (Computer Aided Design) models, rendering them in 
stereo, and implementing haptic force feedback for realistic part 
interaction in virtual environments. Such an application will facilitate 
wider acceptance of the use of a VR interface for prototyping assembly 
tasks. This interface provides both visual and haptic feedback to the user, 
while allowing assembly tasks to be performed on a desktop virtual 
environment. The network module has the ability to communicate with multiple 
VR systems (such as CAVE etc.) at geographically dispersed locations using a 
non-dedicated network channel. The potential benefits of such a system 
include identification of assembly issues early in the design process where 
changes can be made easily, resulting in a more efficient and less costly 
product design process.<P>
