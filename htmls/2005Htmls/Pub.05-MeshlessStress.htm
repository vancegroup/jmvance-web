<STRONG>Abstract</STRONG>
<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
Interactive design gives engineers the ability to modify the shape of a part 
and immediately see the changes in the part's stress state. Virtual reality 
techniques are utilized to make the process more intuitive and 
collaborative. The results of a meshless stress analysis are superimposed on 
the original design. As the engineer modifies the design using subdivision 
volume free-form deformation, the stress state for the modified design is 
computed using a Taylor series approximation. When the designer requests a 
more accurate analysis, a stress re-analysis technique based on the 
pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method is used with parallel processing 
to quickly compute an accurate approximation of the stresses for the new 
design.<P>
