&nbsp;<BR>
This paper presents the development and testing of a tool for designing 
vehicle operator workstations using 3D anthropometry. The tool consists of 
two major modules: 1) a web-based engine to query a large database of human 
anthropometry for selecting human operators representative of a specified 
user population, and 2) an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) software 
application used to view the selected anthropometry in relation to vehicle 
CAD designs. This tool allows a designer to view and interact with fully 
immersive 3D representations of vehicle operator enclosures and controls 
from typical CAD models along with digital human models selected from the 
anthropometry database. This environment allows visualization to aid in the 
trade-off decisions that come between ergonomic and functional (i.e. 
structural, electrical, etc.) design. The environment makes use of a 
web-based interface for the querying of a large anthropometric dataset with 
over 4500 participants. A designer is presented with a rich set of features 
to build, store, and manage queries using attributes such as height, weight, 
reach, gender, and occupation to locate pertinent subsets of subjects for a 
specific vehicle design. A list of subjects obtained from the query engine 
can then be sent to a VR environment for viewing with vehicle CAD data. This 
linkage makes the selecting and viewing of subjects seamless. A detailed 
description of the design problem being addressed, software development, and 
sample test cases are presented to demonstrate the intuitive nature and ease 
of use of the environment.<P>
