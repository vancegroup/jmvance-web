<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Virtual reality (VR) techniques offer us the ability to interact with computer images 
in a way never before experienced. The computer, and later computer graphics,
 revolutionized the way in which engineers design and manufacture products, and 
now virtual reality holds the potential to further revolutionize the engineering 
design cycle by providing engineers with a new window into the computer world. Up
 until recently, virtual reality was the domain of university researchers. With the 
appearance of commercial VR software and peripherals, companies have started building 
virtual reality applications to solve real engineering problems. The focus of this 
paper is to describe just how and where virtual reality fits into the creation and 
production of better products for all of us.
