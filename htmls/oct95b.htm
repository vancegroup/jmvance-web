<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The objective of this paper is to combine virtual reality (VR) and engineering design to
allow a designer to play an active role in analysis and optimization of structural
systems. Virtual reality techniques provide a computer-generated environment for the
designer to investigate multiple design changes by manipulating virtual objects.
Interactive design allows the designer to change design parameters and immediately
determine the effect based on sensitivity-based approximations. Using VR for interactive
design will give the designer an intuitive sense of the performance of the design allowing
the designer to achieve a viable, optimal solution in a timely manner. A simple cantilever
beam with size optimization objectives is presented to illustrate the interactive
sensitivity analysis and design optimization process in a virtual environment.<br>
