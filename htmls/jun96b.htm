<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Surface polygonization is the process by which a representative polygonal mesh of a
surface is constructed for rendering or analysis purposes. This work presents a new
surface polygonization algorithm specifically tailored to be applied to a large class of
models which are created with parametric surfaces having triangular meshes. This method
has particular application in the area of building virtual environments from
computer-aided-design (CAD) models. The algorithm is based on an edge reduction scheme
that collapses two vertices of a given polygon edge onto one new vertex. A two step
approach is implemented consisting of boundary edge reduction followed by interior edge
reduction. A maximin optimization is used to determine the location of the new vertex. The
criterion that is used to control how well the approximate surface represents the actual
surface is based on examining the angle between surface normals. The advantage of this
approach is that the surface discretization is a function of two, user-controlled
variables, a boundary edge angle error and an surface edge angle error. The method
presented here differs from existing methods in that it takes advantage of the fact that
for many models, the exact surface representation of the model is known before the
polygonization is attempted. Because the precise surface definition is known, a maximin
optimization procedure, that uses the surface information, can be used to locate the new
vertex. The algorithm attempts to overcome the deficiencies in existing techniques while
minimizing the number of triangular polygons required to represent a surface and still
maintaining surface integrity in the rendered model. This paper presents the algorithm and
testing results.<br>
