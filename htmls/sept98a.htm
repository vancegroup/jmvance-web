<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper presents an approach to implement virtual reality (VR) as a visualization tool
for the discrete event simulation of manufacturing processes. Visualization is easily
obtained through VR because it can provide an immersive, interactive three-dimensional
environment containing models of all the necessary tools and machines involved in the
manufacturing process. The program described in this paper, the VR Factory, integrates
results from a discrete event simulation into a virtual, three-dimensional, immersive
factory model. The research focuses not only on the creation of a VR replica of a
manufacturing process, but also on the animation of the environment and implementation of
the results of the discrete event simulation.<br>
