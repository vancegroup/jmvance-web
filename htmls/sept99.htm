<p><b>Abstract</b>
<br>This paper discusses the development of a virtual reality (VR) interface
for the visualization of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data. The application,
VR-CFD, provides an immersive and interactive graphical environment in
which users can examine the analysis results from a CFD analysis of a flow
field in three-dimensional space. It has been tested and implemented with
virtual reality devices such as the C2, head mounted display (HMD) and
desktop VR. The application is designed to read PLOT3D structured grid
data and to display the flow parameters using features such as streamlines,
cutting planes, iso-surfaces, rakes, vector fields and scalar fields. Visualization
Toolkit (VTK), a data visualization library, is used along with OpenGL
and the C2 VR interface libraries, to develop the application. Analysts
and designers have used VR-CFD to visualize and understand complex three-dimensional
fluid flow phenomena. The combination of three-dimensional interaction
capability and the C2 virtual reality environment has been shown to facilitate
collaborative discussions between analysts and engineers concerning the
appropriateness of the CFD model and the characteristics of the fluid flow.
