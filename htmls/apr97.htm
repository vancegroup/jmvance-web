<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper presents the results of a project where the purpose was to develop an
interactive virtual environment for the simulation of contact-impact problems. One key
aspect of this project is to include the ability for the designer to interact with the
design in real time and examine the changing analysis results in a simulated
three-dimensional virtual environment. Two problems are used as examples and a virtual
environment for contact-impact problems was developed and evaluated. Through the use of
sensitivity methods, the designer has the ability to change certain design parameters and
immediately view the resultant changes on the analysis results. <br>
