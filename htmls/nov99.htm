<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Hydraulic hoses, which are used to transport high pressure
hydraulic fluid, are key components in many large industrial
vehicles. In the design of an industrial vehicle, designers must
allow sufficient space for hydraulic hoses to pass through the
vehicle. Because these hoses are typically stiff and do not bend
easily, planning the routing of the hoses around components in
the vehicle is challenging. Currently designers use CAD
programs to design vehicles and rely on past experience to
plan hose routes and allow sufficient space for the hoses in a
new vehicle. Later, during the prototype build, the actual hoses
are fit and cut to length to determine exact specifications. This
paper describes the program VRHose which provides the
designer with a three-dimensional interface to aid in planning
hose paths. VRHose allows designers to lay out hose routes
through the vehicle by defining points in space which
constrain the hose path. Virtual reality (VR) is used as the
human-computer interface to provide three-dimensional
viewing and interaction with the digital models. The initial
development of VRHose has concentrated on providing the
user with a three-dimensional input and evaluation tool to lay
out hose routings. Future versions of VRHose will include hose
material properties which will constrain the hose paths to those
which are feasible.
