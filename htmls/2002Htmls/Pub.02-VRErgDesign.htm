<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
This paper highlights a new design paradigm: a shift from traditional digital human modeling methods employing one-dimensional measures to an advanced operator workstation design tool using multi-dimensional data in a fully-immersive, Virtual Reality (VR) environment. This advanced tool enables human factors and other design decisions to be made in a virtual, three-dimensional space, allowing accurate visualization of relationships among human population landmark data and workstation geometry. Whole-body surface scans from approximately 4,500 civilians obtained through the CAESAR project, and 3D anatomical landmark data collected from subjects seated in John Deere seats are used by this tool. Specific methods of data interaction are described. The advantages of immersive applications over traditional desktop simulations, as well as the rationale, development, and implementation of this advanced operator workstation design tool are presented.
