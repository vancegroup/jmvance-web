<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
DN-Edit is a virtual environment developed to allow the manipulation of non-uniform
rational b-spline (NURBS) surfaces using virtual shaping tools. NURBS have become the
industry standard for representation of free-form curves and surfaces. The contribution of
the work presented here is in the development of shaping tools which are used to operate
directly on the NURBS data and change the shape of the surfaces in a virtual environment.
These shaping tools allow surface manipulations to be made using methods that
match the shaping of real malleable objects. The virtual shaping tools are threedimensional
shapes that are controlled through a six degree-of-freedom tracking system
that converts user hand motions into computer input. The NURBS surface updates itself in
real time due to the effect of the tools on the surface. The new shape of the surface is
dependent on the position and orientation of the shaping tool relative to the surface.
Constraint-based surface manipulation is used to obtain multiple point direct manipulation
of NURBS surfaces. In addition, computational methods to allow the user to have
direct control of the first derivative of the surface over an area are implemented. This
application has been developed using the C2 software libraries and Iowa State University’s
C2 surround screen virtual environment.
