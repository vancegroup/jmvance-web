<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming an important tool in the engineering product development process. The virtual environment provides the user with the ability to interact with three-dimensional digital representations of products using natural head and hand motions.  While interacting with digital objects in VR seems natural, the use of traditional two-dimensional menu systems does not always provide a convenient interface to controlling task specifications in the three-dimensional space. New human-computer-interfaces are needed for this emerging VR design tool.  This paper will present the details of implementing a speaker-independent, command and control, speech recognition menuing system for a virtual reality application.  The menuing system will be described as it is incorporated into a virtual environment for the design of spatial mechanisms. Design and technical issues involved in the interface creation process are discussed and the resulting interaction system is described.
