<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
Mechanisms are used in many devices to move a rigid body through a finite sequence of
prescribed locations. The most commonly used mechanisms are four-bar planar mechanisms
that move an object in one plane in space. Spatial mechanisms allow motion in
three-dimensions (3D), however, to date they are rarely implemented in industry in great
part due to the inherent visualization and design challenges involved. Nevertheless, they
do provide promise as a practical solution to spatial motion generation and therefore
remain an active area of research. Spatial 4C mechanisms are two degree-of-freedom
kinematic closed-chains consisting of four rigid links simply connected in series by cylindrical
(C) joints. A cylindrical joint is a two degree-of-freedom joint, which allows translation
and rotation about a line in space. This paper describes a synthesis process for the
design of 4C spatial mechanisms in a virtual environment. Virtual reality allows the user
to view and interact with digital models in a more intuitive way than using the traditional
human-computer interface (HCI). The software developed as part of this research also
allows multiple users to network and share the designed mechanism. Networking tools
have the potential to greatly enhance communication between members of the design team
at different industrial sites and therefore reduce design costs. This software presents the
first effort to provide a three-dimensional digital design environment for the design of
spatial 4C mechanisms.
