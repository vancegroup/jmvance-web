<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
 
The Women in Engineering Leadership Institute (WELI) was formed in February 2001 with a mission to:
<br>!provide training, mentoring and networking opportunities for women engineering faculty in academic leadership,
<br>!provide programs to encourage women engineering PhD students to consider academic careers, and
<br>!serve as a clearinghouse for information and data related to women in academic leadership.
<br>The Institute is an umbrella organization, coordinating activities across a number of academic institutions in the United States and Canada.
The leadership of WELI are planning a series of conferences and workshops over the next two years to fulfill the mission of the organization. One outcome of these activities will be a cadre of women engineering faculty who will export their training experiences to their own institutions as well as to develop material that can be used at any institution.
