<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Virtual reality (VR) technology provides a human-computer interface that
allows participants to interact naturally with digital objects which are
represented as three-dimensional images that occupy positions in a
three-dimensional world. Related to problems of engineering design and
manufacturing, this new technology offers engineers the ability to work
with computer models in a three-dimensional, immersive environment. This
paper describes a virtual reality application where the results of a
discrete event simulation of a manufacturing cell are integrated with a
virtual model of the cell to produce a virtual environment. The program
described in this paper, the VRFactory, combines results from a
commercial discrete event simulation program, SLAM II, with a virtual
environment. This allows the user to investigate, using
three-dimensional computer models, how various changes to the
manufacturing cell affect part production. This investigation is
performed while immersed in a computer-generated three-dimensional
representation of the cell. Existing discrete event programming software
allows only two-dimensional views of the factory as the parts progress
through the simulation. Parts are shown only as primitive geometric
shapes on the computer monitor and instantaneously move from one station
to the next. The virtual environment implementation of the SLAM II
results allows users to experience the simulation in a fully immersive
three-dimensional digital environment. The virtual environment used here
is a cave-like projection screen-based facility called the C2 which is
located at Iowa State University. This paper describes the creation of
the VR model of the manufacturing cell, the animation of the environment
and the implementation of the results of the discrete event simulation.<br>
