<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Virtual Reality (VR) provides a design space consisting of three-dimensional computer
images where participants can interact with these images using natural human motions in
real time. In the field of engineering design, prototyping and design verification have
provided the initial application areas for VR. The research presented in this paper takes
the scenario one step further by incorporating free-form deformation techniques and
sensitivity analysis into the virtual world such that the designer can easily implement
analysis-based shape design of a structural system where stress considerations are
important. NURBS-based free-form deformation (NFFD) methods and direct manipulation
techniques are used as the interface between the VR interaction and the finite element
model. Sensitivity analysis is used to allow the designer to change the design model and
immediately view the effects without preforming a re-analysis. An engine connecting rod is
analyzed to demonstrate how virtual reality techniques can be applied to structural shape
design.<br>
