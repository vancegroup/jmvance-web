<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This NSF CAREER Award is focused in two areas:research and education. The 
research focus is on investigating virtual reality (VR) techniques to 
improve product design. Initial efforts have centered on investigating 
the usefulness of virtual reality for engineering design applications, 
first by applying VR techniques to the design of spherical mechanisms. 
The education focus of this project is on developing faculty and staff 
development techniques to integrate active learning techniques into the 
engineering classroom. The PI is a leader in the effort at Iowa State 
University to educate faculty and teaching assistants on the use of active learning techniques.
