<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper describes the development of a virtual reality environment which facilitates
the design of spherical four-bar mechanisms. A short discussion of spherical mechanism
design theory and computer-aided mechanism design is followed by a description of the
virtual environment and the development and operation of the SphereVR program. The virtual
environment allows the user to naturally interact with the input data and specify the
design parameters while operating in a three-dimensional environment. We see this
development as a logical extension of existing graphics-based spatial design software. The
need for a three-dimensional design space is driven by the difficulty in specifying design
inputs and constraints for a spatial problem using a two-dimensional interface. In
addition, once the mechanism has been created, the virtual environment provides the
opportunity for the user to visually verify that the mechanism will perform the desired
three-dimensional motion.<br>
