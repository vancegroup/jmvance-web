<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Computer-controlled manufacturing systems have been adopted by major industries over the
last few years to provide manufacturing flexibility and increased product quality. Small
manufacturers can also benefit from implementing these advanced manufacturing technologies
in their organizations, but are often impeded by the lack of skilled workers. Local area
community colleges possess the educational structure to train these workers but not the
state-of-the-art equipment necessary for hands-on training. The desired training is by
it's nature very resource intensive. State-of-the-art manufacturing equipment is very
expensive and out of the range of the average community college equipment budget.
Simulation-based training can be implemented to provide cost effective training on a wide
variety of manufacturing tools. Libraries of equipment models can be developed and
upgraded as new machines are introduced to the marketplace. In addition, simulation-based
training provides a safe environment where novice machine tool operators can learn without
fear of injury to themselves or the equipment. Because of the safe environment, a larger
student-to-instructor ratio can be maintained, resulting in further cost savings. Also,
with each student at a workstation, students are not restricted to operate the machinery
in groups and therefore each student can gain individual experience programming the
machines. This paper presents the organization, development, and operation of software
that has been created to train manufacturing technicians to operate computer-controlled
manufacturing systems. The software is based on Deneb's TELEGRIP simulation software and
OSF/Motif software.<br>
