<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper describes a graphical technique used for investigating the effects of
structural design changes on the sound pressure levels generated in an automobile
compartment. Low frequency noise in the passenger compartment (in approximately the 20-85
Hz frequency range) is of primary interest, and particularly that noise which is generated
by the structural vibrations of the wall panels and various other smaller parts of the
compartment. A designer faced with reducing the noise levels at various frequencies
typically has several hundred design variables as candidates for change. This paper
describes a computer interface that facilitates understanding of the effect various design
changes have on the noise levels. This interface allows the designer to investigate the
design space to determine which variables hold the most promise for achieving the
objectives of noise reduction and allows the designer to set targets or constraints, to a
desired confidence level, using the sensitivity information of these design variables. The
design targets set in this manner are then input to an optimization algorithm which solves
for the optimized sound pressure level.<br>
