Discrete event simulation is often used to identify manufacturing issues early
in the design process in order to avoid unnecessary capital investment and
significant rework of a manufacturing process. The majority of the simulation
software packages currently provide animation capability so designers can
visually examine part flow thorough the faculty. These tools, however, confine
designers to viewing post-processed simulation results using the traditional
two-dimensional computer interfaces, such as the monitor, keyboard and mouse,
with limited options for making real-time changes to the simulation scenario.
This paper presents a novel general-purpose simulation analysis application that
combines concurrent simulation with the advanced data interrogation and user
interaction capabilities of immersive virtual reality systems. The application
allows for interactive modification of the simulation parameters, such as
assembly tasks’ durations, while providing the users with the available
simulation information by effectively placing the operator in the midst of the
environment being simulated. Implementation and functionality details of the
developed application are presented. Feedback from designers who used the
application to analyze a proposed manufacturing operation is also discussed.<o:p>
