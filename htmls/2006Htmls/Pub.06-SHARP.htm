&nbsp;<BR>
Virtual Reality (VR) technology holds promise as a virtual prototyping tool 
for mechanical assembly; however, several developmental challenges still 
need to be addressed before virtual prototyping applications can 
successfully be integrated into the product realization process. This paper 
describes the development of SHARP (System for Haptic Assembly &amp; Realistic 
Prototyping), a portable VR interface for virtual assembly. SHARP uses 
physically-based modeling for simulating realistic part-to-part and 
hand-to-part interactions in virtual environments. A dual handed haptic 
interface for realistic part interaction using the PHANToM® haptic devices 
is presented. The capability of creating subassemblies enhances the 
application’s ability to handle a wide variety of assembly scenarios. Swept 
volumes are implemented for addressing maintainability issues and a network 
module is added for communicating with different VR systems at dispersed 
geographic locations. Support for various types of VR systems allows an easy 
integration of SHARP into the product realization process resulting in 
faster product development, faster identification of assembly and design 
issues and a more efficient and less costly product design process.<P>
