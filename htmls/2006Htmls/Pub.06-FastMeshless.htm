&nbsp;<BR>
Multiple design iterations often require repeated stress analyses to be 
performed as the design is modified slightly. We present a method that 
combines the meshless stress analysis method with a reanalysis technique to 
avoid repeating the time consuming steps of re-meshing and solving for small 
design changes. An iterative reanalysis method based on the pre-conditioned 
conjugate gradient method is introduced and compared to the linear Taylor 
series, simple iteration, and combined approximations reanalysis methods. 
The asymptotic running time is presented for each reanalysis method and 
accuracy is compared for two example problems: a cantilever beam and a 
hole-in-plate. Results show the Taylor series to have the fastest run time, 
followed in order by simple iteration, pre-conditioned conjugate gradient, 
and combined approximations. For the two example problems, accuracy of the 
simple iteration method is poor for design change greater than 5%. Taylor 
series accuracy depends greatly upon the choice of the design variable, the 
example problem, and the method for computing the sensitivity. The combined 
approximations and pre-conditioned conjugate gradient methods both 
demonstrate less than 10% error up to a 100% change in height for the 
cantilever beam and 30% change in radius for the hole-in-plate example.<P>
