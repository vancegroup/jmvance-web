<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This paper presents a new approach to using virtual reality (VR) to design spherical
mechanisms. VR provides a three-dimensional design space where a designer can input design
positions using a combination of hand gestures and motions and view the resultant
mechanism in stereo using natural head movement to change the viewpoint. Because of the
three dimensional nature of the design and verification of spherical mechanisms, VR is
examined as a new design interface in this research. In addition to providing a VR
environment for design, the research presented in this paper has focused on developing a
&quot;design in context&quot; approach to spherical mechanism design. Previous design
methods have involved placing coordinate frames along the surface of a constraint sphere.
The new &quot;design in context&quot; approach allows a designer to freely place geometric
models of movable objects inside an environment consistig of fixed objects. The fixed
objects could either act as a base for a mechanism or be potential sources of interference
with the motion of the mechanism. This approach allows a designer to perform kinematic
synthesis of a mechanism while giving consideration to the interaction of that mechanism
with its application environment. <br>
