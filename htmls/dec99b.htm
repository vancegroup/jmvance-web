<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

This paper presents a new approach to using virtual reality (VR) to design 
spherical mechanisms.  VR provides a three-dimensional (3-D) design space 
where a designer can input design positions using a combination of hand 
gestures and motions and view the resultant mechanism in stereo using 
natural head movement to change the viewpoint. Because of the three-
dimensional nature of the design and verification of spherical mechanisms, 
VR is examined as a new design interface in this research.  In addition to
providing a VR environment for design, the research presented in this paper 
has focused on developing a ``design in context'' approach to spherical 
mechanism design.  Previous design methods have involved placing coordinate 
frames along the surface of a constraint sphere.  The new "design in context"
 approach allows a designer to freely place geometric models of movable 
objects inside an environment consisting of fixed objects. The fixed objects 
could either act as a base for a mechanism or be potential sources of 
interference with the motion of the mechanism.  This approach allows a 
designer to perform kinematic synthesis of a mechanism while giving 
consideration to the interaction of that mechanism with its application 
environment.<p>
