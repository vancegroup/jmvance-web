<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
This NSF Career Award was to fund research into (1) the use of virtual reality 
techniques to improve product design and (2) the implementation of active
learning techniques in the engineering classroom.<p>

<strong>Research:</strong><p>
The focus of this work is to develop and evaluate virtual reality (VR)
applications in various areas of mechanical engineering in order to
determine what benefits virtual reality techniques provide to engineers
over existing computer aided tools.  This year with support from Ford,
Boeing, Deere, and Procter and Gamble the work had broadened to include
not only conceptual design, but also engineering analysis and factory
simulation.<p>

Work on examining the use of VR for conceptual design has focused on
designing spherical mechanisms in a virtual environment.  Based on the
results of a study performed last year comparing a VR application to a
traditional workstation-based application [1], a new VR spherical
mechanism design application was developed (Figure 1) [2].  This
application allows the designer to design the mechanism around
three-dimentioanl models of the area where the mechanism will be used. 
Pro/Engineer models can be brought directly into the virtual environment
and the mechanism can be designed right on the models.  This provides
the designer with a more realistic and natural view of the design as it
develops.  Collision detection also is implemented to indicate where the
mechanism would interfere with objects in the environment.<p>
