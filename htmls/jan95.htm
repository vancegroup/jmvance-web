<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The objective of this research is to develop a technique that allows a designer to play 
an active role in the design optimization process.  This will be
accomplished by combining fast optimization methods, based on
sensitivity analysis, with virtual reality techniques to provide an
interactive method for design optimization. Fast optimization methods
are needed to allow large design problems to be investigated in an
interactive time frame.  Virtual reality techniques provide an
interactive environment for the designer to investigate multiple design
changes.  Keeping the designer active in the design process allows
insights that have been gained from experience to be incorporated into
the optimization process, resulting in better designs achieved in a
timely manner.
