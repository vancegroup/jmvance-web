<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
By using design sensitivity analysis (DSA) to approximate the change in an attribute
response, a method of cross-attribute optimization was developed. This method and the
software that supports it is independent of the analysis tools used to generate the
baseline response, and DSA data. This software tool allows groups of engineers using
different computer aided engineering tools to visualize how a design change will impact
all aspects of a design. The software also allows the engineer to run an optimization
based on the linear model of the system. This optimization will run quickly, allowing the
engineer to do many &quot;what if&quot; studies without the need for a time consuming
re-analysis of the system. The engineer can then take the results of the linear
optimization and re-analyze any designs that look promising. This approach to
cross-attribute optimization has been implemented at Ford Motor Company with success.<br>
