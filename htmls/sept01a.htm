<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Virtual Reality techniques provide a unique new way to interact with three-dimensional
digital objects.  Virtual prototyping refers to the use of virtual reality to obtain 
evaluations of designs while they are still in digital form before physical protoypes 
are built.  While the current state-of-the-art in virtual reality relies mainly on the 
use of stereo viewing and auditory feedback, commercial haptic devices have recently 
become available that can be integrated into the virtual environment to provide force 
feedback to the user.  This paper outlines a study that was performed to determine whether 
the addition of force feedback to the virtual prototyping task improved the ability 
of the participants to make design decisions.  The specific task involved comparing the 
location and movement of two virtual parking brakes located in the virtual cockpit 
of an automobile.  This paper describes the purpose, methods and results of the study.
