<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The purpose of this project is to create a virtual environment for 
engineering design optimization. NURBS-based free form deformation 
techniques have been combined with stress sensitivities and implemented 
in a virtual environment to allow a designer to change the shape of a 
design and immediately view the stress distribution changes. 
Designer-weighted optimization is implemented to guide the designer to 
investigate designs in the vicinity change the shape of the design using 
natural three-dimensional movements. Stereo viewing further enhances the 
three-dimensional appearance and interpretation of computer-generated 
geometry. This intuitive interface allow the designer to concentrate on 
evaluation of the analysis results and provides a natural interface to 
interacting with computer images and databases.
