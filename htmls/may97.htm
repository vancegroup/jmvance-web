<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The objective of this paper is to combine virtual reality (VR) and 
engineering design to allow a designer to play an active role in analysis 
and optimization of structural systems. Virtual reality techniques 
provide a computer-generated environment for the designer to investigate 
multiple design changes by manipulation virtual objects. Interactive 
design allows the designer to change design parameters and immediately 
determine the effect based on sensitivity-based approximations. Using VR 
for interactive design will give the designer an intuitive sense of the 
performance of the design allowing the designer to achieve a viable, 
optimal solution in a timely manner. A simple cantilever beam with size 
optimization objectives is presented to illustrate the interactive 
sensitivity analysis and design optimization process in a virtual 
environment.
