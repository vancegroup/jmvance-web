<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Virtual reality can be seen as a logical evolution of existing human-computer interfaces.
Virtual reality techniques attempt to remove the barriers of the traditional computer
interface, consisting of the keyboard, monitor and mouse, and allow the user to experience
the &quot;reality&quot; of a computer-generated scene. This computer technology holds the
potential to revolutionize the way in which engineers rely on computers to help build,
test, and verify designs. Some of the areas where VR can contribute to increase
engineering productivity are in the areas of design, prototyping, design for maintenance
and assembly, factory planning, networked design, and concurrent engineering.This paper
presents a general description of the field of virtual reality followed by a discussion of
the potential impact of virtual reality on the engineering profession. Several ongoing
research projects in the area of virtual design are described and preliminary results are
presented.<br>
