<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Because of the desire to produce better products and improve competitiveness, manufacturers are
increasingly turning to virtual prototyping. This development follows a logical historical progres-sion
of the use of computers in engineering design and manufacturing. Today the benefits of com-puter
modeling are being realized and immersive virtual reality is being investigated as a design
tool for engineers. As the new century approaches, computer-aided design continues to hold
promise for facilitating new and better products. This paper outlines some of the applications of
virtual prototyping currently being developed and concludes with the author's view of the future
of virtual reality as applied to engineering problems.
