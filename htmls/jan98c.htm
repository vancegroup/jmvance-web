<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to enhance the 
engineering design process, but before industry embraces them, the 
benefits must be understood and documented. The current research compared 
two software applications, one workstation based and one VR based, that 
were developed to aid engineers in designing complex three-dimensional 
spherical mechanisms. Participants used each software to design a 
spherical mechanism and then evaluated the software interface. 
Participants rated their ability to interact with the computer images, 
their feelings about each interface, and their preferences for which 
interface device to use for certain tasks. The results indicated that 
participants preferred a workstation interface for interaction tasks and 
a VR interface for visual tasks, but the former preference may have 
reflected differences between the software in the complexity of how each 
task was implemented. These results provide information about how to 
improve implementation of VR technology for spherical mechanism design.
