<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The most commonly proposed application area in engineering for virtual 
reality (VR) technology is the development of virtual simulations and 
prototypes. This work extends the use of VR technoloty beyond those 
application areas by demonstrating its use as an interactive analysis and 
design tool. This work combines analysis results with design geometry in 
a virtual environment and allows the designer to interactively 
investigate various design configurations and view the resultant changes 
on the alalysis results. In order to provide analysis results in a timely 
manner, sensitivity methods are used to approximate the changes in 
stresses, displacements, mode shapes, etc. Once a suitable design has 
been achieved based on the analysis approximations, an optimization is 
performed to verify the design.
