<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

This award provides funding to develop a new and innovative approach to 
designing spatial mechanisms based on the use of virtual reality technology.  
A virtual environment, which will include a variety of visual, audio, and 
haptic interactive devices, will be created and used to design novel spatial 
mechanisms.  New analytical techniques for spatial mechanism design which 
fully utilize the capabilities of the virtual design environment will be 
generated and incorporated into the design software.  Computer models of 
objects within the operational workspace of the mechanism will be displayed 
in the virtual environment and consideration of the interaction of the 
mechanism with these objects will become an integral part of the design 
process.  This development will be a test bed for the use of virtual reality 
in mechanical design. If successful, this research will result in a computer 
tool that utilizes novel spatial mechanism design methodologies to generate 
a three-dimensional design space in which the designer can synthesize spatial 
mechanisms and obtain a sense of the form and function of the devices.  This 
would enable spatial mechanisms to be incorporated into many products, 
including manufacturing and automation equipment and consumer products.  As a 
result of this research, new advancements in spatial mechanism design 
methodology and new knowledge pertaining to the use of virtual environments as 
mechanical design tools are likely.
