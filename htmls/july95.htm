<strong>Abstract</strong><br>
The research that is currently underway is focused on developing the 
interaction strategies and algorithms to support virtual engineering 
design. With the increased development of virtual reality equipment and 
declining computer prices, the possibility for virtual reality to be a 
common design tool is approaching. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to 
enhance engineering design in the early stages of conceptual design, in 
the prototyping stage of design, and during design analysis evaluation. 
The challenge is to develop the interaction strategies that will allow 
users to natually interact with the virtual objects in the 
computer-generated environment. Preliminary result s are presented where 
virtual environments have been created to enhance conceptual design, 
prototype verification and analysis-based design.
