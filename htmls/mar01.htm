<strong>Abstract</strong><br>

Virtual Reality applications are making valuable contributions to the field of
product realization.  This paper presents an assessment of the hardware and software 
capabilities of VR technology needed to support a meaningful integration of VR
applications in the product life cycle analysis.  Several examples of VR applications
for the various stages of the product life cycle engineering are presented as case studies.
These case studies describe research results, fielded systems, technical issues, and
implementation issues in the areas of virtual design, virtual manufacturing, virtual
assembly, engineering analysis, visualization of analysis results, and collaborative 
virtual environments.  Current issues and problems related to the creation, use, and 
implementation of virtual environments for engineering design, analysis, and 
manufacturing are also discussed.
